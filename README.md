This repository contains the code, models, and data pipeline for building a LinkedIn Job Recommender. Given a userâ€™s resume, the system:

Classifies the resume into a career category

Recommends relevant job postings from a large dataset of LinkedIn job descriptions

Our goal: help users discover suitable jobs based purely on the text of their resumes.


Project Overview
1. Resume Classification
We train models to classify resumes into one of ~25 career categories (e.g. Engineer, Finance, Teacher, etc.) using:

TF-IDF vectorization
Logistic Regression
SVM
Naive Bayes
Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV

3. Job Recommendation
We compute similarities between resumes and job descriptions to recommend the Top 5 jobs for each resume:

Vectorization methods:
TF-IDF
CountVectorizer
spaCy embeddings
BERT embeddings (optional)

Hyperparameter tuning:
max_features
ngram_range

Evaluation metric:
Mean Top-5 Cosine Similarity
